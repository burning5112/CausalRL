# Code for "Rule Learning with Causal Intervention for Knowledge Graph Reasoning"

We propose a novel causal learning paradigm and a corresponding rule learning framework called **CausalRL** to handle the confounders issue in knowledge reasoning.
CausalRL introduces a controlled randomized confounders and differentiation module to simulate confusing information introduced by different variables, and achieves causal intervention by simulating the process of coupling and causal reasoning.
This design enables the model to decouple causality and confounders. Meanwhile, by attaining the optimal causality,
CasualRL can utilize essential properties of relations to guide the entire rule learning process, and more accurately utilize the semantic consistency between rule bodies and rule heads. 
Through an extensive series of comparative and ablation experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our causal learning paradigm and its ability to derive high-quality rules based on causality.
Moreover, we show that CausalRL yields state-of-the-art results for knowledge graph completion across five publicly available datasets.

The paper code will be published after the paper is accepted.
Thank you for your interest.
